=[ Introduction ]=
pmacct is a set of network tools to gather, filter and tag IP traffic; it is
able to store collected data either into a DB or a memory table.
We see any monitoring, billing or accounting environment as a stack where data
are picked from the network, get processed in a meaningful way, and optionally
formatted to be user-friendly. In the context of this layered approach we also
see pmacct residing at its lowest layer (that is, just upon the network); once
collected, often data need to be pulled to upper layers of the environment for
a range of applications like time-based reporting, pricing model application, 
policy enforcement, network thresholds handling, nice output to end-users.
pmacct-contribs aims to be over the time a collection, though still absolutely
not exaustive, of works revolved around or topped over pmacct.

A personal and genuine 'thank you' goes to all people listed below. I really
appreciate and recognize them for their enthusiastic efforts. Paolo.

=[ Description of contributions ]=

- dcm1/daemontools
These scripts will help if you intend to run pmacctd under daemontools. They
should apply without troubles to nfacctd and sfacctd aswell. Further details
about daemontools are at the folowing URL: http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html 

- gsm1/weblog
This script lists the traffic gathered by pmacct, paging through the results,
ordered by stamp_updated. It uses XTemplate, a powerful PHP template library,
already included into the package.  

- kop1/pmacct-socat
A client-server couple of scripts, exports memory plugin UNIX sockets across
the net to allow remote queries.

- kop1/pmacct2rrd
It's a script to feed pmacct data to RRDtool at fixed time intervals. Written
in Python.

- ps1/<pmacct scripts suite>
This package is a collection of scripts aimed to find, extract and show meaningful
informations from the MySQL/PostgreSQL database where network data are collected
by pmacct. The scripts are based on a common library that effectively make them
work in conjunction with both MySQL and PostgreSQL.

- rs1/showTraffic
showTraffic generates reports for data written by pmacct into a database like
MySQL. It could either show all traffic by interface in and out or traffic at
a list of ports for one interface. 

- rs1/rc
rc script modified for use with pmacct; it allows to start multiple instances
of pmacctd reading configuration files from a specified directory. 

- wk1/check-running.pl
This script can be added as a service check in Nagios to ensure that pmacct is
counting traffic properly. The SQL part is written for PostgreSQL but could
easily be tweaked to run with MySQL. 

- wk1/check-sniff.sh
Checks that the sniffing interface is still up, in promiscuous mode, and has the
correct speed/duplex settings.  

- st1/quagga_gen_as_network.pl
A script to generate a AS number/network file (networks_file) in pmacct format
from Quagga
